      <h1>Welcome to my neighborhood</h1>

      <p>It's kind of weird to welcome you to Tempe cause I don't know much about this place myself. I just moved here less than a month ago. It's right outside of Phoenix, AZ, and is a nice mix between suburbs and city.</p>
      <p>So now I live in the middle of the desert with my cousin. It's too hot at the moment to leave the house during the day, but I'm really excited for it to cool down in the fall.</p>
      <p>I've lived in the same place for my whole life up to this point, so it's been really cool to experience what it's like to live in places different from my own.</p>

      <h2>Skating</h2>
      <p>Tempe is super pedestrian friendly. There's whole areas just dedicated to people walking, biking, riding those annoying electric scooters, and skating.</p>
      <p>Most nights you can find me and my cousin skating over at Tempe Town Lake or the ASU campus. Both are really close to our house.</p>

      <h2>Food</h2>
      <p>We've been eating out a lot, and the amount of food options here are crazy! My favorite place so far is Kabuki, a sushi restaurant.</p>

      <p>I tried raw fish for the first time here, and it was delicious and fresh. I might be going back this weekend too :)</p>
