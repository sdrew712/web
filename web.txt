The internet is a bunch of computers communicating with each other. 
When people host websites, they would like to be able to close their computers without
their website going down, so they often host them using computers that always run, for
example, ones owned by Amazon.

A domain is a link to an IP address that is easy for users to remember. When you click
on a link, your browser tries to find the IP address for that site through different ways.
It starts by checking your local cache. If the address cannot be found there, it checks
your modem, then asks your ISP, then finally, if it still cannot locate the address, gets
it from the root DNS server.
